### Python web frameworks

- Flask

### Flask

Flask is a lightweight web framework optimal for building small, simple web applications or for prototyping ideas quickly. Flask supports core web server functionality such as routing & request handling, templating, static files, and database integration.

### Django

Django is a full-featured web framework designed to help developers build large, complex data-drive web applications as quickly as possible. It includes a powerful ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) for working with databases, a template engine for rendering HTML, and support for web sockets. 

Django has a large community of 3rd-party tools to support caching, request handling, background operations, authentication, and other essential functionality.

### Async

Developers can use a Python-based asynchronous framework to build web applications that can handle multiple requests concurrently, similar to a node.js application. Aysnc capabilities can improve the performance and scalability of an application.

Some widely used async frameworks are:

- FastAPI
- AioHttp
- Quart
